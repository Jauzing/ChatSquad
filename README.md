# ChatSquad

## Description
ChatSquad is a program where you can chat to different AI-based personalities inside a simple GUI.
The model has some contextual memory, and it stores all textdata as prompt;completion pairs.
This is because the model was originally used to create data for fine-tune training my own model.
